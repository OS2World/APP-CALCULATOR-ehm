ehm 0.6   README 09.03.2011

ehm is a little calculator written with QT4.

This is a port for OS/2. The original project is in:

http://code.google.com/p/ehm/

Note

Since 0.3 version, I've to change the original sources adding the
following lines to ehm.cpp:

#if defined(__OS2__)
  #define log2(value) log((double)value)/log(2.0)
#endif
